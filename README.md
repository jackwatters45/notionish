# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

General checks

- sidebar has modal open -> esc should not close sidebar (same for clicks)
- add horizontal margin (50 -> 96px)
- redirecting in offline mode (or maybe just in general?) when dbItem or view does not exist

drag stuff

- actually do drag stuff
- adding new todo should place it at bottom
- sorting (use order field?)
- cursor while dragging

very end

- test what It would look like to add the snap listener once done
