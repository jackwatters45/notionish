# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

Next

backend

- sidebar

- setting data (state and backend) - sidebar -> views -> properties)

rename everything better + clean up

- some check to make sure select properties are unique
- gonna need to do something about date

- have a feeling I'm gonna run into issue with trying to change id
- save everything backend but the front end takes care of rendering
- also rename + clean up

- loading page
- not sure how to sort now??? (adding new todo should place it at bottom)
- update drag and drop last
- select is broken
- cursor styling
- make sure context good still

- test what It would look like to add the snap listener once done

- wrap shit in try blocks
- sign out make sure works
- table responsiveness
- clicking table sidebar button -> type error

- I think adding data to new property should be fine but if running into error it has to do with how the property is created

- I think best bet for sorting is to use an order field

- add id when creating new todos
- add horizontal margin

- add to select property -> needs to be added to sort and filters if being used??

// TODO go through use popup and switch order of parameters
// TODO make sure sorts and filters working well
Clean up
