# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

Next

backend

- sidebar -> properties

- some check to make sure select properties are unique
- not sure how add drag (adding new todo should place it at bottom)
- select is broken
- cursor styling
- make sure context good still
- test what It would look like to add the snap listener once done
- sign out make sure works
- I think best bet for sorting is to use an order field
- add id when creating new todos
- add horizontal margin (50 -> 96px)
- add to select property -> needs to be added to sort and filters if being used??
- cursor while dragging
- useLayoutEffect vs useEffect for sidebar and modal stuff
// TODO view overflow

- sidebar has modal open -> esc should not close sidebar (same for clicks)
