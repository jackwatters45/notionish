# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

- dropdown menus
- drag and drop
- editing project (on click -> input??)

- when a new property is added all the todos need to be updated
- notes hold a value and html?
- depending on hov i do labels may run into problem with hover

next

- TODO different types of components (text, date, number, url, created time, select, notes)
