# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

Still todo

- drag and drop
- views
- sort
- filter
- backend

Random Notes

- eventually use draft js for notes section
- drag or click styling
- index file for exporting properties
- when a new property is added all the todos need to be updated
- notes hold a value and html?
- depending on hov i do labels may run into problem with hover
- prevent paste maybe - oncopy="return false" oncut="return false" onpaste="return false">
- for properties -> inline style and just get properties count for the repeat
- view uses router (so does each todo but idk if necessary)
- may be better to use z-index for controlling clicks off popup and sidebar (if something needs to be closed etc) but for now just using state (main-context: line 68)
- property is upper case (not guaranteed) and is being converted to lowercase in the custom hooks. Probably a bad way to do this

Currently

- add button
- turn into row obj
- styling
- when add property make sure it is added to todo 'constructor' as well

- add property
- delete property
- fix tab bs
