# Todo list I created a while back adapted to use react

Next

backend

- finished db crap -> still do rest

- setting data (state and backend)

rename everything better + clean up

- some check to make sure select properties are unique
- gonna need to do something about date

- have a feeling I'm gonna run into issue with trying to change id
- save everything backend but the front end takes care of rendering
- also rename + clean up

- loading page
- not sure how to sort now??? (adding new todo should place it at bottom)
- update drag and drop last
- select is broken
- cursor styling

- test what It would look like to add the snap listener once done
